# Virtual Environment Setup Guide

## ✅ You're All Set!

Your inventory system is now running in a virtual environment. Here's what this means:

### 🔒 **Why Virtual Environment?**
- **Isolation**: Dependencies don't conflict with other Python projects
- **Professional**: Industry standard practice for Python development
- **Portable**: Easy to share and reproduce the exact environment
- **Clean**: Keeps your system Python installation clean

### 🏃‍♂️ **How to Run Your System**

**Option 1: Manual Activation**
```powershell
# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run your system
python main.py
```

**Option 2: Use the Convenience Scripts**
```powershell
# Just double-click or run:
.\run.bat       # Runs the system automatically
.\setup.ps1     # Runs setup process
```

### 📦 **Current Setup**
- ✅ Virtual environment created in `venv/` folder
- ✅ No external dependencies needed (uses Python standard library)
